# RESTAURANT AM AMMERSEE

"Restaurant am Ammersee" is a full-stack, responsive website designed as a practical exercise in web development. This project simulates a real-world scenario where a restaurant located on Lake Ammersee needs an online presence to showcase its menu and manage table reservations.

This project served as a valuable learning experience in various web development technologies, including front-end design, back-end logic, and database management. It demonstrates the ability to create a functional and user-friendly web application that meets the needs of a modern restaurant business.

Note: This website is intended for educational purposes only and does not represent a real business or accept actual reservations.

## Agile Methodology

This project was developed following Agile principles, which emphasizes iterative development, continuous feedback, and a flexible approach to accommodate changes.  I used GitHub Issues to maintain a dynamic and transparent record of all User Stories and tasks. You can explore the project's evolution and all documented issues [here](https://github.com/Amila3951/restaurant_ammersee/issues).

Agile development allowed me to adapt to new insights and challenges throughout the project lifecycle. By breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and prioritizing essential features, I ensured a consistent focus on delivering a functional and valuable product.

To visually manage the project's workflow and track progress, I utilized a Kanban board. This provided a clear overview of tasks and their progress without imposing strict time constraints, allowing for flexibility and adaptability throughout the development process. While I opted for a flexible approach without fixed timeboxes for each iteration, the Kanban board helped me visualize the workflow and prioritize tasks effectively, ultimately contributing to better time management and a more focused development process.
