## Agile Methodology

This project was developed following Agile principles, which emphasize iterative development, continuous feedback, and a flexible approach to accommodate changes. I used GitHub Issues to maintain a dynamic and transparent record of all User Stories and tasks. You can explore the project's evolution and all documented issues [here](https://github.com/Amila3951/restaurant_ammersee/issues).

Agile development allowed me to adapt to new insights and challenges throughout the project lifecycle. By breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and prioritizing essential features, I ensured a consistent focus on delivering a functional and valuable product.

To visually manage the project's workflow and track progress, I utilized a Kanban board. This provided a clear overview of tasks and their progress without imposing strict time constraints, allowing for flexibility and adaptability throughout the development process. While I opted for a flexible approach without fixed timeboxes for each iteration, the Kanban board helped me visualize the workflow and prioritize tasks effectively, ultimately contributing to better time management and a more focused development process.
