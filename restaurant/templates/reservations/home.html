        <p> The year is 1953. A young couple, newly married and brimming with dreams, open the doors to a quaint
          little
          restaurant on the shores of the Ammersee. They pour their hearts and souls into their venture, using
          cherished family recipes passed down through generations to create a menu that is both comforting and
          unique. Word of their delicious food and warm hospitality spreads, and soon, the restaurant becomes a
          beloved local institution.<br> </p>

          your meal with a selection from our thoughtfully curated wine list, featuring both local and international
          gems. <br> </p>
